# üìö Books Management [.NET Core WebAPI]

A `.NET Core Web API` project that manages books and their categories using **Onion Architecture**. This project integrates several modern technologies and design patterns such as `Entity Framework Core`, `SQL Server`, `UnitOfWork`, `Repository Pattern`, `Generic Interfaces`, `Serilog` for logging, `AutoMapper` for object mapping, and `Swagger` for API documentation.

## üåü Project Overview

BooksManagement.NETCoreWebAPI is designed to help manage a collection of books and their categories. The system provides CRUD operations for both books and categories, adhering to best practices with clean architecture and separation of concerns.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **.NET Core Web API**
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database interactions.
- **SQL Server**: The relational database used for storage.
- **Onion Architecture**: To ensure a clean separation of concerns.
- **Serilog**: For structured logging and monitoring.
- **AutoMapper**: For object-to-object mapping (e.g., DTOs to models).
- **UnitOfWork Pattern**: For transaction management across repositories.
- **Repository Pattern**: For encapsulating data access logic.
- **Swagger**: To generate API documentation and explore endpoints.
- **Generic Interfaces**: To make repositories reusable and scalable.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows **Onion Architecture** to ensure the separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. This is achieved by dividing the project into the following layers:

- **Core Layer**: Contains the business logic, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and interfaces for services and repositories.
- **Service Layer**: Implements the business logic and handles the application‚Äôs workflows.
- **Repository Layer**: Manages database interactions using the `Entity Framework Core` and `Repository Pattern`.
- **API Layer**: The presentation layer that exposes the API endpoints for client interactions.

## ‚ú® Features

- CRUD operations for books and categories.
- Separation of concerns using `Onion Architecture`.
- `AutoMapper` for handling DTOs and entity mapping.
- Structured logging using `Serilog`.
- `Swagger` integrated for interactive API documentation.
